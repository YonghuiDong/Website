Hi there!

My name is Yonghui Dong. I am an analytical chemist. I am currently working at Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. My research interests include mass spectrometry imaging, metabolomics and chemoinformatics. You can find more information about me [here](en/about).

 I love coding because it really excites me. R and Python are my favorite programming languages.

On this website I present some of my scientific research, and write about things that I found interesting, mostly related to sciences and my life experience.
